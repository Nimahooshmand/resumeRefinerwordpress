## Setup
1. Copy this theme folder into `wp-content/themes/resume-refiner` inside your WordPress installation.
2. Activate **Resume Refiner** under *Appearance ? Themes*.
3. Assign menus for **Primary Menu** and **Footer Menu** (the header and footer will display automatic fallbacks if not set).
4. Add at least one widget to the *Footer Column* area for richer footers.
5. Create a page and set it as the static front page (Settings ? Reading) to display the landing layout.

Optional: create blog posts to populate the Insights grid on the homepage.
